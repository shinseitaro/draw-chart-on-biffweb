# Biffweb and ApexChart

This repository is a simple explanation of how to display charts on Biffweb.

What I have done is: 

- Added ApexChart to `ui.clj`
- Added `/chart` routing
- Added fixture data
- Implemented in `chart.clj`
- Wrote JavaScript in `main.js`

After cloning this repository and running `clj -M:dev dev`, you should be able to see a Bar chart at http://localhost:8080/chart.
